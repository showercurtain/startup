# Sentence Scrambler

I want to hear a quote from Dr. Doofenshmirtz mixed up past recognition. this fancy app will be able to take any voice clip, split up the words automatically or with your help, and mix them up into a technically valid English sentence. After making your silly sentence scramble, you will be able to upload it to the cloud to share it with all your friends!
